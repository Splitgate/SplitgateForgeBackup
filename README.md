# Splitgate Forge Backup
Archive of any/all Forge maps backend data from Splitgate 1.

## Reason
This will keep maps playable via custom backends that people can host. It also means people can use that to try to remake the maps they have put a lot of work into elsewhere without only relying on old photos.

## Submission
To submit any map codes you want here, create an issue on this repository with the map code and some more information such as the creator and maybe even a photo of the map.

> [!TIP]
> Any forge map that is backed up here is with permission of the creator.
